# CLI-repo-quickstart

## About

A simple command-line application that simplifies the process of setting up a new project repository. Often, 
developers might like to create a standard README and .gitignore, but this can sometimes require manual work
and context-switching. I built this tool for my own convenience, but I'm hoping that it might be helpful for
others as well!

Inspired by Fireship's [CLI Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oHByo8tiEY)
