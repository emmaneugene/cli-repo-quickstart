# CLI-repo-quickstart

## About

A simple command-line application that simplifies the process of setting up a new project repository. Often,
developers might like to create standard files, but this can sometimes involve manual work in copying templates
and context-switching. I built this tool for my own convenience, but I'm hoping that it might be helpful for
others as well.

This tool can create the following files:
`README.md`
`.gitignore`
`.editorconfig`


Inspired by Fireship's [CLI Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oHByo8tiEY)
